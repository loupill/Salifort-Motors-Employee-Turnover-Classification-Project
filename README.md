# Salifort-Motors-Employee-Turnover-Classification-Project


## Overview
This project aims to assist an imaginary company facing a high rate of employee turnover by developing a classification model to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the organization. Predicting employee attrition can help companies take proactive measures to retain valuable talent, reduce recruitment costs, and maintain a healthy work environment.

We implemented and compared four classification models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest Classifier, and XGBoost Classifier, to identify the most effective solution for predicting employee turnover as well as specifying the features that are most influential towards employees leaving. 

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
- The dataset was thoroughly cleaned to handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed using various techniques, including boxplots, histograms, and bar charts, to gain insights into the data and understand the factors contributing to employee turnover.

## Models
We implemented the following classification models:

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Decision Tree**
3. **Random Forest Classifier with RandomsizedSearchCV**
4. **XGBoost Classifier with RandomsizedSearchCV**

These models were evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC to determine their predictive performance.
